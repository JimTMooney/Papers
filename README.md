# Papers
A repository to keep track of papers/articles I have read with their corresponding summaries. This is useful as a sanity check for remembering what each paper does for future citations. The papers are organized both by general category as well as specific projects I have worked on.

## General Categories
This section contains generic categories of papers. For initializing my in depth understanding of this field, I lifted several hundred of the first papers here from https://github.com/maziarraissi/Applied-Deep-Learning (what a fantastic resource by the way for anyone interested in the field of deep learning).

### Optimization




## My Projects
This section contains references to papers useful for specific projects I have worked on.
